  color1: '9'
  color2: 'b'
# language: self-explanatory, following languages are available and need to be written exactly like that.
# german, english
# For easier changing, do it with the /language command in-game or in the console.
language: german
# prefix: This is the prefix of your plugin. You can change it here or easier in-game or in the console with the command /prefix
# Leave after the prefix a blank space!!!
# You can set the accent colors or your own. The advantage of the accent colors is that you no longer have to change them in the prefix when you change the color.
# For accent colors use this:
# - accent color 1: %color1%
# - accent color 2: %color2%
# - individual colors: %CharOfTheColor% (check here: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/)
prefix: '%color1%[%color2%Tische SMP%color1%] %8%| '

# !FROM HERE ON DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING, EXCEPT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO!
# If you change something here and the plugin breaks as a result, then it is either due to your change or to my programming skills.
