# language: self-explanatory, following languages are available and need to be written exactly like that.
# german, english
# For easier changing, do it with the /language command in-game or in the console.
# command: /language <language>
language: german
# prefix: This is the prefix of your plugin. You can change it here or easier in-game or in the console with the command /prefix
# Leave after the prefix a blank space!!!
# You can set the accent colors or your own. The advantage of the accent colors is that you no longer have to change them in the prefix when you change the color.
# For accent colors use this:
# - accent color 1: %color1%
# - accent color 2: %color2%
# - individual colors: %CharOfTheColor% (check here: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/)
# No command for this, only here changeable.

# homes: Here you can set up the homes system as you like.
# If you like you can turn them off. If you like to use them, then you can set up following aspects:
# - status: want to use the system? Type in 'true', if not then 'false'.
# - maxNumber: this rules the maximum number of homes that each player is allowed to have.
# - instant: this rules manages the teleportion. If you want that the player can teleport instantly, then write true.
#            this rule is helpful, when you want to prevent players, to teleport instantly away from a bad situation (like from fall damage or void) and save themselves.
#            if set at false, the player needs to stand three seconds still to be teleported.

# spawn: Here you can set up the spawn command
# - status
# - location: this is the location of your spawn. DON'T CHANGE IT HERE, CHANGE IT WITH THE COMMAND IN-GAME!
# - mustBeNearby: this flag changes, how the players can teleport to the spawn.
#                 If set to true, then the player must be in the 500*500*500 area to be teleported to spawn. Center of that area is the spawn location.
# - elytraFlyAway: can players glide down from spawn? This is very helpful, when you have a flying island.

  mustBeNearby: false
  elytraFlyAway: true

# !FROM HERE ON DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING, EXCEPT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO!
